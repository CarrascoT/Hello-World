# Hello-World
just another respository

"Heard joke once: man goes to doctor. 
says he's depressed. 
sys life seems harsh and cruel.
says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain.
doctor says "treatment is simple. great clown pogliacci is in town tonight. 
go and see him.
that should pick you up.
man bursts into tears.
says "but doctor..."
"...i am pogliacci.""
